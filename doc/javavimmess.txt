INTRODUCTION                                *javavimmess*

Most java & JEE developers say If you're doing java you should Use an IDE.
This plugin is an example of the fact You can say I souldn't leave vim just to
use java and it doesn't slow me down in fact it does the opposite (of course
you should be fluent with java and with vim for this to be true).

DISCLAIMER                                  *javavimmess-disclaimer*

Despite the name javavimmess relies in well stablished java conventions and
prefer spaces over tab chars for indentation and because of this some
shortcuts and commands may not work for you. If this is  your case any bug
report or pull request for enhancenments and corrections is appreciated.

This plugin is a work in progress and some commands really need a better error
handling an it probably needs your help.
